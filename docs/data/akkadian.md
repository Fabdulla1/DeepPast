# Akkadian Text in Transliteration

The OA corpus includes 13,000 digitized texts written in Old Assyrian Akkadian. These transliterations—using Latin letters and diacritics—represent the scholarly reading of cuneiform signs. Standard transliteration conventions (ORACC/CDLI/Leiden) are followed, with particular attention to preserving determinatives and line-level formatting.

# English Translation

Where available, clause-level English translations accompany the Akkadian text. Sentence alignment is essential: participants will train models to learn mappings from Akkadian’s Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure into English’s Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). A good model learns from literal, word-for-word translations—even if they differ from polished academic versions.

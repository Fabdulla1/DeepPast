# About the Deep Past Initiative

The Deep Past Initiative is a groundbreaking project dedicated to preserving and digitizing ancient Mesopotamian history through innovative crowdsourcing technology.

## Our Mission

We aim to unlock the secrets of over **22,000 ancient cuneiform tablets** by engaging a global community of contributors in our digitization challenge.

### What Are Cuneiform Tablets?

Cuneiform tablets are ancient clay documents that contain some of humanity's earliest written records, including:

- Trade records from Assyrian merchants
- Legal documents and contracts
- Literary works and religious texts
- Historical chronicles
- Mathematical and astronomical calculations

### Why This Matters

These tablets represent a treasure trove of human knowledge spanning over 4,000 years. By digitizing them, we:

1. **Preserve History**: Make ancient knowledge accessible to future generations
2. **Enable Research**: Allow scholars worldwide to study these documents
3. **Connect Cultures**: Bridge the gap between ancient and modern civilizations
4. **Democratize Access**: Make historical documents available to everyone

## The Challenge

Our innovative platform combines:
- **Machine Learning**: Advanced AI to assist in tablet recognition
- **Language Translation**: Cutting-edge tools for cuneiform translation
- **Crowdsourcing**: Global community participation
- **Gamification**: Competitive elements with prizes and recognition

Join us in making history accessible to all!

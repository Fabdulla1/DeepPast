The Deep Past Initiative (DPI) is launching a series of machine learning competitions to advance research in the world‚Äôs oldest written languages. This first challenge focuses on Old Assyrian, a dialect of Akkadian used in the early second millennium BCE in the trading archives of merchants at Kanesh (K√ºltepe, modern-day Turkey). While over 25,000 texts are known, fewer than half are translated‚Äîmaking this a critical area for AI support.

Participants are invited to tackle four escalating challenges:

1. [**Transliteration to Translation (Text-to-Text)**](./overview.md)  
   Translate Akkadian texts (in Latin-script transliteration) into English, aligning clause-level or sentence-level segments.

2. **Unicode Codepoints to Transliteration (Script-to-Text)**  
   Convert sequences of Unicode cuneiform signs into standardized Akkadian transliterations.

3. **Image to Unicode Codepoints (Image-to-Script)**  
   Use segmented tablet photos to recognize and identify cuneiform signs as Unicode codepoints.

4. **Tablet Image Segmentation (Image-to-Regions)**  
   Segment raw photos of clay tablets into individual line or sign regions suitable for downstream OCR and tokenization tasks.

Prizes will be awarded for each stage over the course of multiple rounds.

Here are four well-framed ‚Äúproblem statements‚Äù for the technical AI/ML audience, corresponding to the four challenges in your Kaggle-style competition. Each is concise, grounded in real ML framing, and sets up the historical motivation with a clear technical objective.

## üß© Machine Translation: Akkadian Transliteration to English Translation (Text-to-Text)

### Problem

Old Assyrian texts are preserved in Latin-script transliterations of Akkadian, a morphologically rich, low-resource language written in SOV order. The goal of this task is to build a model that can translate clause-aligned sequences of transliterated Akkadian into modern English. The architecture could use neural machine translation (NMT) or LLMs or any other architecture and the best outcome will receive the prize. Unlike high-resource benchmarks, these texts include non-standard orthography, domain-specific vocabulary, and many rare tokens‚Äîmaking generalization especially challenging. Alignments are noisy or incomplete in parts of the dataset, and performance depends critically on literal, structure-preserving translation. The outcome: models that can reliably render ancient administrative records into English, enabling broader historical and linguistic access.

### Advice

Pay close attention to the tokenization step, since there are currently no tokenizers made for Akkadian transliteration, this is typically where most models fail.

### How to handle the gap/lacuna in Akkadian transliterations

| Token   | Meaning                           | How created                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `‚ü®unk‚ü©` | Exactly one illegible sign        | Regex `\b[xX]\b` or `[x]` ‚Üí `‚ü®unk‚ü©` |
| `‚ü®gap‚ü©` | One or more missing signs‚ÄØ/‚ÄØlines | Regex `` `\\.\\.\\.``               |

_Both tokens are added to the tokenizer before training; evaluation scripts ignore their content but require them to be copied verbatim._

### Document the convention for competition

- Use the following substitutions:
  - `‚ü®unk‚ü©`‚ÄØ=‚ÄØexactly one illegible sign (e.g. ‚Äòx‚Äô ‚Äò‚Ä¶‚Äô)
  - `‚ü®gap‚ü©`‚ÄØ=‚ÄØone or more illegible signs **or** a lacuna of one or more whole lines (e.g. [x x], [...], (n lines missing), etc.)
- These tokens **must be copied verbatim** in system outputs; BLEU / chrF evaluation scripts can then ignore them or score them as literals.
- Provide a _validation script_ that checks no other gap symbols sneak back in.

### Why not keep the original bracket soup?

- Tokenisers would split `[...]` into `[, ..., ]`, giving the model three embeddings instead of one.
- `x` clashes with genuine x‚Äôs in Sumerograms (`x≈°ut` etc.) and with mathematical symbols in year names.
- Participants spend time reproducing your private conventions instead of focusing on translation quality.

The Deep Past Initiative (DPI) is launching a series of machine learning competitions to advance research in the world’s oldest written languages. This first challenge focuses on Old Assyrian, a dialect of Akkadian used in the early second millennium BCE in the trading archives of merchants at Kanesh (Kültepe, modern-day Turkey). While over 25,000 texts are known, fewer than half are translated—making this a critical area for AI support.

Participants are invited to tackle four escalating challenges:

1. [**Transliteration to Translation (Text-to-Text)**](./challenge.md)  
   Translate Akkadian texts (in Latin-script transliteration) into English, aligning clause-level or sentence-level segments.

2. **Unicode Codepoints to Transliteration (Script-to-Text)**  
   Convert sequences of Unicode cuneiform signs into standardized Akkadian transliterations.

3. **Image to Unicode Codepoints (Image-to-Script)**  
   Use segmented tablet photos to recognize and identify cuneiform signs as Unicode codepoints.

4. **Tablet Image Segmentation (Image-to-Regions)**  
   Segment raw photos of clay tablets into individual line or sign regions suitable for downstream OCR and tokenization tasks.

Prizes will be awarded for each stage over the course of multiple rounds.

Here are four well-framed “problem statements” for the technical AI/ML audience, corresponding to the four challenges in your Kaggle-style competition. Each is concise, grounded in real ML framing, and sets up the historical motivation with a clear technical objective.
